# Pneumonia Detection Using VGG16 and Transfer Learning

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture, utilizing transfer learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The goal is to build an automated system that can accurately classify chest X-rays as either normal or indicative of pneumonia, potentially aiding in the early diagnosis of this serious condition.

## Project Overview
Pneumonia is a life-threatening respiratory infection that requires timely and accurate diagnosis. In this project, we utilize deep learning techniques to build a model capable of detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is based on the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, and fine-tuned to classify X-ray images into two categories: normal and pneumonia.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) provided by Paul Mooney on Kaggle. It contains 5,863 X-ray images categorized into two classes:
- **Normal**: 1,583 images
- **Pneumonia**: 4,273 images

## Model Architecture
The model is built using the following architecture:
- **Base Model**: VGG16 pre-trained on ImageNet (with frozen weights)
- **Input Size**: 224x224 pixels
- **Output Layer**: Dense layer with 2 units and a softmax activation function for binary classification

### Key Model Parameters
- **Image Size**: 224x224 pixels
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy
- **Number of Epochs**: 5 (can be adjusted based on performance)

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pneumonia-detection.git
   cd pneumonia-detection
Here's your text converted into comma markdown language:

```
# Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Download the dataset:

Download the dataset from Kaggle and extract it to the appropriate directory (e.g., `./data/chest_xray/`).

# Hyperparameter Tuning

Hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can significantly affect the model's performance. In this project:

- The **batch size** is set to **32**, balancing memory usage and training speed.
- The **learning rate** can be tuned using a learning rate scheduler or manually setting it within the optimizer (e.g., Adam).
- The **number of epochs** is initially set to **5**, but you can increase it for potentially better results.

To tune these hyperparameters:

- **Adjust the batch size**: Modify the `batch_size` parameter in the `ImageDataGenerator` functions.

- **Adjust the learning rate**: Set the `learning_rate` parameter in the Adam optimizer:

```python
optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)
```

- **Adjust the number of epochs**: Modify the `epochs` parameter in the `model.fit()` function.

# Training the Model

To train the model, execute the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will start the training process using the VGG16 model with transfer learning. The model's performance will be evaluated on the test set after each epoch.

# Results

The model achieved a training accuracy of **96%** in detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. 

# Usage

After training, you can use the model to make predictions on new chest X-ray images:

```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

The script will output whether the X-ray is classified as **"Normal"** or **"Pneumonia"**.
